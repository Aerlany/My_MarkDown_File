### Listen, You Shouldn't Be Doing HIIT Every Day

HIIT, which stands for **high-intensity interval training**, is a form of exercise that **alternates** short bursts of intense activity to raise the heart rate with **recovery** periods of lower-intensity exercise or rest, says Ellen Thompson, CPT, a NASM-certified personal trainer.

Since HIIT **workouts** can get the job done in just 15 to 20 minutes, on average, they seem like the perfect way to exercise whenever you're in the mood for a short but sweet round of cardio.

So many **sweaty** exercises fit into the HIIT format, meaning it's accessible and easy to add to your workout routine. But that doesn't necessarily mean you can do HIIT every day.

Can You Do HIIT Every Day?

When considering how often you should do a certain type of exercise, Thompson says it's important to look at certain **factors**, like how intense it is and how long it lasts.

Yoga and walking, for example, are super gentle and easy on the body, which is why it's OK to do them every day. HIIT workouts, on the other hand, are all about pushing yourself to the limit, and thus require a few days off in between."The prevailing recommendation is to do HIIT workouts no more than two to three times per week," Thompson says."That's because HIIT is a high-intensity form of exercise that puts a lot of stress on the body."Because it's so physically taxing, Thompson says daily HIIT workouts can quickly lead to overtraining, injuries, and burnout.

Eventually, you'll notice that you're too tired or too sore to maintain good form and technique, she says, and that's when injuries can happen. How Long To Wait Between HIIT Workouts With this style of intense training, Thompson says it's super important to allow time for the body to rest and recover between workouts."Ideally, you would aim to recover at least 48 hours between HIIT workouts."She recommends listening to your body to know when you're ready to take on your next **sesh**.

Another option is to do 15 to 30 minutes of HIIT three times a week and eventually work up to four with rest days in between, says Emily Skye, a trainer and founder of Emily Skye FIT."The process of muscle repair and growth happens when you stop, rest, and sleep," Skye explains, so there's truly no need to do HIIT every day.



### What To Do After An Internship

If your <u>ultimate</u> career goal is to <u>land</u> a job in your desired field, an internship can be a step in the right direction.
 ( ultimate adj.最终的，最后的 ) ( land v.着陆，降落，获得 n.陆地，地面 )

A good internship <u>involves</u> learning <u>practical</u> skills, working alongside professionals in the field and — most importantly — helping you get closer to your dream job.
（ involve v.涉及，包含 ）（ practical adj.真实的，实际的 ）

These are things you're probably already <u>naturally</u> thinking about as you're wrapping up a summer internship. But if you want to get the most out of the experience, it's <u>critical</u> you do a few things before (or right after) your end date.
（ naturally adv.天然的 ）（ critical adj.重要的，关键的 ）

1. Note Your <u>Accomplishments</u>
   Set goals for yourself when you start an internship. Once you've achieved them, remember this advice about the business world's <u>competitive</u> culture: 

   <u>Humility</u> is not a <u>virtue</u> when it comes to ensuring your hard work is noticed by others.

   Whether you are listing your accomplishments in a <u>self-evaluation</u> or on your résumé, be clear about what you accomplished.

   A title is not enough; provide details about the actions you took to achieve a goal, especially if they are <u>quantitative</u>.

   （ accomplishments adj.成就，功绩 ）（ competitive adj.竞争的 ）
   （ Humility n.谦逊 ）
   
2. Get Manager <u>Feedback</u>
   Before wrapping up your internship, ask your <u>supervisor</u> for a <u>brief</u> meeting to discuss your strengths and weaknesses. Asking for feedback shows your supervisor that you take your work seriously and are open to improving.

   

3. Update Your Resume
   You should update your résumé at least once a month as you gain new experiences and learn new skills. If you wait until you're <u>applying for</u> a job to update your résumé, you may forget important points that would help you <u>stand out</u>.

   Your résumé shouldn't just list your job and internship titles. Use <u>bullet</u> points and active <u>verbs</u> to describe the responsibilities you held, the goals you met and the <u>innovative</u> <u>strategies</u> you implemented while working. 

   A strong résumé includes both <u>qualitative</u> and <u>quantitative</u> accomplishments. For example, if a project you worked on during your internship resulted in an online publication, include a <u>hyperlink</u> to the article in your résumé.

   

4. Request References
   Résumés can only say so much. Employers rely on references to learn about an <u>applicant's</u> work <u>ethic</u> and personality — it's important for them to know what it's like to work with you and how you function in a team environment.

If you've established a good relationship with someone at your internship site, see if they would be willing to serve as a reference in the future — and make sure to ask whether they would like to be <u>contacted</u> by email or by phone.

### Prevalence  of  Obesity and Associated Complications In China

Researchers from the First Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital analyzed data of about 15.8 million eligible participants from 519 Meinian health check-up centers across 243 cities in China.Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of a person.The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in meters.As per Chinese BMI classification, 34.8 percent of the studied population was overweight and 14.1 percent was obese.The eligible participants were aged 18 or above.And 52.8 percent were male.

About 41.1 percent of Chinese men were overweight or obese compared with 27.7 percent of Chinese women, and 18.2 percent of men were obese compared to 9.4 percent of women.The prevalence of overweight peaked at age 50 to 54 in males and at age 65 to 69 in females.The prevalence of obesity peaked at age 35 to 39 in males and at age 70 to 74 in females.By region, the proportion of overweight and obesity in the north is generally higher than that in the south, with Inner Mongolia (37.1 percent), Shandong (37.1 percent), and Hebei (36.6 percent) ranking among the top three.

Due to poor diet and sedentary behavior, the population with metabolic syndrome, characterized by abdominal obesity, has increased significantly in modern times, said Li Buman, deputy director of endocrine immunology department at Tsinghua University Yuquan Hospital.According to the World Health Organization, eating and exercise is crucial for individuals:

1. Limit energy intake, especially in the form of fat and sugar.

2. Eat more fruits and vegetables, as well as legumes, whole grains and nuts, such as eating at least 400 grams of fruits and vegetables per day.

3. 3.Engage in regular physical activity, such as 60 minutes a day for children and 150 minutes a week for adults.

   

### Paper Drinking Straws May Be Even Worse Than Plastic

Does using an ec-friendly paper straw give you a good feeling because you're doing something for the enviroment? You might want to rethink that.

A new study <u>contents</u> that paper drinking straws may not be more enviromentally friendly than plastic straws and could pose significant health risks to users as well.
The study <u>reveal</u> the <u>presence</u> of "<u>forever chemicals</u>" - compound that can <u>persist</u> for thousands of years -  in these straws, linking them to cancers, thyroid, and liver issues.

Out of the 39 straw brands examined, 90 percent of the paper <u>variants</u> had chemicals known as Poly And Perfluoroalkyl <u>Substances</u> (PFAS).
These chemicals were prevalent in straws, especially those made of paper and bamboo. Notably, only the <u>stainless steel straws</u> were free of PFAS.

PFAS chemicals, notorious for their longevity and potential harm, can adversely affect humans, wildlife, and the environment.They are linked to various health issues, including decreased vaccine responsiveness, liver damage, and kidney cancer."Straws made from plant-based materials, such as paper and bamboo, are often advertised as being more sustainable and eco-friendly than those made from plastic," says Dr. Thimo Groffen, the study's corresponding author and an environmental scientist at the University of Antwerp.

"However, the presence of PFAS in these straws means that's not necessarily true."For a more in-depth analysis, the researchers acquired 39 distinct straw brands made from five materials: paper, bamboo, glass, stainless steel, and plastic.These straws, mainly sourced from retailers and eateries, underwent two PFAS testing rounds.A staggering 69 percent of these brands contained PFAS, with 18 distinct types of PFAS identified.	

Paper straws were the primary culprits, with 90 percent testing positive for PFAS.These chemicals were also found in 80 percent of bamboo straws, 75 percent of plastic straws, and 40 percent of glass straws.Stainless steel straws, however, were completely PFAS-free.Although the PFAS levels were minimal and straws are used sporadically, these chemicals can accumulate in the human body over years."Small amounts of PFAS, while not harmful in themselves, can add to the chemical load already present in the body," says Dr. Groffen.

"The presence of PFAS in paper and bamboo straws shows they are not necessarily biodegradable," Dr. Groffen concludes."We did not detect any PFAS in stainless steel straws, so I would advise consumers to use this type of straw."
