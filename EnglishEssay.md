### Listen, You Shouldn't Be Doing HIIT Every Day

HIIT, which stands for **high-intensity interval training**, is a form of exercise that **alternates** short bursts of intense activity to raise the heart rate with **recovery** periods of lower-intensity exercise or rest, says Ellen Thompson, CPT, a NASM-certified personal trainer.

Since HIIT **workouts** can get the job done in just 15 to 20 minutes, on average, they seem like the perfect way to exercise whenever you're in the mood for a short but sweet round of cardio.

So many **sweaty** exercises fit into the HIIT format, meaning it's accessible and easy to add to your workout routine. But that doesn't necessarily mean you can do HIIT every day.

Can You Do HIIT Every Day?

When considering how often you should do a certain type of exercise, Thompson says it's important to look at certain **factors**, like how intense it is and how long it lasts.

Yoga and walking, for example, are super gentle and easy on the body, which is why it's OK to do them every day. HIIT workouts, on the other hand, are all about pushing yourself to the limit, and thus require a few days off in between."The prevailing recommendation is to do HIIT workouts no more than two to three times per week," Thompson says."That's because HIIT is a high-intensity form of exercise that puts a lot of stress on the body."Because it's so physically taxing, Thompson says daily HIIT workouts can quickly lead to overtraining, injuries, and burnout.

Eventually, you'll notice that you're too tired or too sore to maintain good form and technique, she says, and that's when injuries can happen. How Long To Wait Between HIIT Workouts With this style of intense training, Thompson says it's super important to allow time for the body to rest and recover between workouts."Ideally, you would aim to recover at least 48 hours between HIIT workouts."She recommends listening to your body to know when you're ready to take on your next **sesh**.

Another option is to do 15 to 30 minutes of HIIT three times a week and eventually work up to four with rest days in between, says Emily Skye, a trainer and founder of Emily Skye FIT."The process of muscle repair and growth happens when you stop, rest, and sleep," Skye explains, so there's truly no need to do HIIT every day.



### What To Do After An Internship

If your <u>ultimate</u> career goal is to <u>land</u> a job in your desired field, an internship can be a step in the right direction.
 ( ultimate adj.最终的，最后的 ) ( land v.着陆，降落，获得 n.陆地，地面 )

A good internship <u>involves</u> learning <u>practical</u> skills, working alongside professionals in the field and — most importantly — helping you get closer to your dream job.
（ involve v.涉及，包含 ）（ practical adj.真实的，实际的 ）

These are things you're probably already <u>naturally</u> thinking about as you're wrapping up a summer internship. But if you want to get the most out of the experience, it's <u>critical</u> you do a few things before (or right after) your end date.
（ naturally adv.天然的 ）

1. Note Your <u>Accomplishments</u>
   Set goals for yourself when you start an internship. Once you've achieved them, remember this advice about the business world's <u>competitive</u> culture: 

   <u>Humility</u> is not a <u>virtue</u> when it comes to ensuring your hard work is noticed by others.

   Whether you are listing your accomplishments in a <u>self-evaluation</u> or on your résumé, be clear about what you accomplished.

   A title is not enough; provide details about the actions you took to achieve a goal, especially if they are <u>quantitative</u>.

   

2. Get Manager <u>Feedback</u>
   Before wrapping up your internship, ask your <u>supervisor</u> for a <u>brief</u> meeting to discuss your strengths and weaknesses. Asking for feedback shows your supervisor that you take your work seriously and are open to improving.

   

3. Update Your Resume
   You should update your résumé at least once a month as you gain new experiences and learn new skills. If you wait until you're <u>applying for</u> a job to update your résumé, you may forget important points that would help you <u>stand out</u>.

   Your résumé shouldn't just list your job and internship titles. Use <u>bullet</u> points and active <u>verbs</u> to describe the responsibilities you held, the goals you met and the <u>innovative</u> <u>strategies</u> you implemented while working. 

   A strong résumé includes both <u>qualitative</u> and <u>quantitative</u> accomplishments. For example, if a project you worked on during your internship resulted in an online publication, include a <u>hyperlink</u> to the article in your résumé.

   

4. Request References
   Résumés can only say so much. Employers rely on references to learn about an <u>applicant's</u> work <u>ethic</u> and personality — it's important for them to know what it's like to work with you and how you function in a team environment.

If you've established a good relationship with someone at your internship site, see if they would be willing to serve as a reference in the future — and make sure to ask whether they would like to be <u>contacted</u> by email or by phone.
